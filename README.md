# siri-n8n-assistant
I built a smarter Siri by connecting it with n8n. This assistant goes beyond remindersâ€”handling email (summaries, draft replies), calendar (daily agenda, smart scheduling), and web research (quick AI answers). A portfolio project showing how AI + automation can turn Siri into a real personal assistant.
